Banking System Database Project

Welcome to my Banking System Database Project! This repository showcases the work I completed during a collaborative project focused on developing a robust and secure banking system application. The project demonstrates practical applications of database design, SQL querying, and web development concepts.

Project Overview
Our team developed a comprehensive banking database system that allows customers to access their personal banking data while ensuring the security of their credentials. The project encompasses various aspects of modern banking, including:
    Customer account management
    Transaction processing
    Card services (Credit and Debit)
    Security implementations
  
- Key Features: 
    Normalized database design
    Complex SQL queries for data extraction and analysis
    Security measures including password hashing and input validation
    HTML/CSS frontend for user interaction
  
- Technologies Used :
    HTML and CSS for frontend design
    PHP for server-side scripting
    MySQL for database management
    WinSCP for file transfer
    Brackets as the primary IDE

-Project Structure
The repository contains various files demonstrating different aspects of the banking system, including:
    Database schema and normalization
    SQL queries for data analysis and retrieval
    PHP scripts for backend functionality
    HTML/CSS files for the user interface
  
- Database Structure: 
The database is carefully normalized to ensure data integrity and efficiency. It includes tables for:
    Customers
    Accounts (with subtypes for Checking and Savings)
    Cards (with subtypes for Credit and Debit)
    Transactions

- Security Measures: 
We've implemented several security features to protect user data:
    Password hashing
    Input validation and sanitization
    Secure database design
  
- Challenges and Learning Outcomes: 
Throughout this project, we faced and overcame various challenges:
    Developing complex SQL queries
    Resolving database connectivity issues
    Debugging schema-related problems
    Coordinating team efforts under time constraints
These challenges provided valuable learning experiences in SQL, HTML/PHP usage, database design principles, and teamwork.

- Future Enhancements:
We have identified several areas for future improvement:
    Implementing ad-hoc queries and adjusting tables for enhanced cryptographic dependencies
    Strengthening Customer and Admin Dashboards
    Implementing data masking for sensitive information
    Exploring more secure encryption methods
    Adding HTTPS encryption for all web requests (with SSL certificate)
  
Conclusion
This project represents our team's dedication to understanding and implementing real-world banking data management solutions. We welcome any feedback or contributions to further enhance this system.
Thank you for your interest in our Banking System Database Project!
